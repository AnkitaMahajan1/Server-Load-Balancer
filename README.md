How to Run Locally
To run the Server Load Balancer on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/server-load-balancer.git](https://github.com/AnkitaMahajan1/Server-Load-Balancer.git)
Install Dependencies:
cd server-load-balancer
create a virtual environment

Start Backend Servers:
python backendServer.py
python backendServer2.py
Ensure that your backend servers are running on ports 5001, 5002, and 5003.(or any of these ports)

Run the Load Balancer:

python app.py --health-check-interval 10 --health-check-url /health
This command starts the load balancer on port 80 and configures it to perform health checks every 10 seconds using the /health endpoint.
