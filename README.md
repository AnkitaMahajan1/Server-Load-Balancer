# Server-Load-Balancer
Server Load Balancer is a simple Python application that acts as a load balancer for distributing incoming requests among multiple backend servers. It provides round-robin load balancing and health checks to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
Features
üîÑ Round-Robin Load Balancing: Requests are evenly distributed among the available backend servers using a round-robin algorithm.

‚ö†Ô∏è Health Checks: The load balancer periodically checks the health status of backend servers and excludes unhealthy servers from the rotation.

üåê UI Dashboard: The load balancer includes a web-based dashboard for monitoring the status of backend servers and their health.

Technologies Used

How to Run Locally
To run the Server Load Balancer on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/server-load-balancer.git
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd server-load-balancer
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Backend Servers:

Ensure that your backend servers are running on ports 5001, 5002, and 5003.

Run the Load Balancer:

bash
Copy code
python load_balancer.py --health-check-interval 10 --health-check-url /health
This command starts the load balancer on port 80 and configures it to perform health checks every 10 seconds using the /health endpoint.

Access the UI:

Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1/ui to view the server status dashboard.
